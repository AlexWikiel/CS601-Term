media queries to accomplish this.
3. Use selectors to style all appropriate elements on all pages using CSS.

## Description

This weeks assignment required us to style our page content.  I had some trouble with this
as its my first exposure to CSS.  I had to watch some tutorials but the one that really
helped and allowed me to mimic some of the controls was this from youtube:

Changes to the initial 5 pages are minimal in mostly just styling.  The main and most time intestive
was the navigation, but using the tutorial above I was able to make it work with semantic elements
The nav now uses hovers to undeline each selection.  We also change sizes at 1040px and to smaller font
on the index page we make my picture change size too and disappear.  When we get to 410px the entire nav 
menu reduces and all the thrills are removed for mobile devices. The nav is shared by all the pages, so the 
style is in template.css.

Education page has nice school links which lights up when we hover over them. Personal Life page was also
styled to add a drop shadow to the image and align all parts.  Personal interest page has drop shodows 
added to the picture and to the table.  The table is also padded and a border added. here we used the aside
element with css to get a nice text wrap around the table.  It adjusts really nicely as you change the size
of the screen. the Favorites page also has nice links with highlights plus I made a border around the video
and added a drop shadow.

Two new pages were added, TV Corner and News. These will seem similar as my efforts were focused on styling
the existing pages.
