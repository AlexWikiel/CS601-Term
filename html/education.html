        <h2>My Education Background:</h2>

        <p>I graduated from Bishop Hendricken High School in 1999 and headed to the University of Rhode Island. I had
            been accepted into their engineering program. Once there, I made the decision to change majors to Marketing
            and Business. It was a more mainstream major that seemed to offer “cool” perks and it appealed to me as a
            younger man at the time.</p>


        <p>After graduating from URI, I went on to work within the field for a period. An opportunity came up at my
            current place of work that led me back to science and reignited the “old” me. I have always loved technology
            and tinkering with things to figure out how they work. I knew I wanted this now and in the future. This led
            me to BU and the MSSD program. As I reach the end of my program, there is no doubt that I have made the
            right choice and I am excited for what future endeavors this new level of education will bring.</p>
