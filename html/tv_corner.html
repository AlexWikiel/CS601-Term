                <h2>The Office</h2> <!-- image obtained https://www.tvinsider.com/show/the-office/-->
                <p>By far, one of my most watched shows ever. It is the show that I turn to when I cannot figure out what to
                    put
                    on and the one I put on as background noise. The jokes never get old. It is the perfect combination of
                    stupidity and understated humor. I could laugh at Michael Scott’s awkward antics all day. Whether he is
                    “Date Mike” or “Prison Mike,” I’d be happy to be his Assistant TO the Regional Manager just for a day.

                <h2>Blue Bloods</h2>  <!-- image obtained https://www.tvinsider.com/show/blue-bloods/ -->
                <p>First of all, Tom Selleck. How does this man do it?! He is a firm leader that quietly commands respect
                    from those around him. Underneath that exterior is a man with a big heart for those he cares for. Then
                    you add in Donnie Wahlberg and some crazy police drama…wow. This show takes up 99% of my DVR and I am
                    not sorry for it.</p>

                <h2>Seinfeld</h2>  <!-- image obtained https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/top-10-the-sopranos-episodes-6583146/ -->
                <p>The reason why I hesitate to lick envelopes. It is described as “a show about nothing,” yet I find it to
                    be so entertaining. The cast is relatable, though a little embellished for cinematic purposes. Jerry is
                    known to be obsessive but indifferent at the same time. The questions he asks about the situations
                    around him are very often ones I would have asked myself. The way the cast plays off each other makes
                    for great entertainment.</p>

                <h2>The Sopranos</h2>  <!-- image obtained https://www.tvinsider.com/show/the-office/-->
                <p>I consider The Sopranos a cult classic for my generation. On the surface, it seems like another show
                    about mobsters. The dark comedy actually has themes and symbolism embedded throughout. Its complexities
                    are so well woven into the storyline that many often miss them during their first watch. I highly
                    recommend it!</p>
