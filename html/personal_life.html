        <h2>My Personal Life:</h2>
        <p>As I said, I currently live in Rhode Island with my family.  I am outnumbered in my household by my wife and two daughters.  Luckily, I have my Puggle whose name is Bruno as my right hand man.  My daughters are in elementary school so there are many Soccer Saturdays and trips to the zoo.  One of our favorite places to go as a family is the
             <a href="http://biomescenter.com/">Biomes.</a>
               We try to spend as much time at the beach during the warmer months as we can and love hanging around the fire pit in the evenings.  My wife and I have been married for 10 years.  She is a nurse by profession but I title her as my favorite person (and my favorite cook).</p>
        <p>I currently work at 
            <a href="http://www.Technic.com">Technic Inc.</a>
             and have been there for 13 years.  I began as a chemical technician and then moved into product development.  During my time in product development, I took on more coding which has recently shifted me into a role as a programmer.  It has been a great opportunity for growth since the beginning.  I have learned so much as a result and even been able to travel the world with my company.</p>
